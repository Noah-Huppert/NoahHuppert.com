#Source Control
I use `Git` for source control in most of my projects. I consider myself fairly proficient at using git. The regular series of commands(`add`, `commit`, and `push`) have become like a second language for me. When it comes more complected commands such as merging branches and files I consider myself slightly less proficient however I can still use them correctly.  

I am also practiced in Git branch based work flows. I frequently create branches for fixing bugs or taking a different approach to a problem
